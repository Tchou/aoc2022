# aoc2022
Repository for the [advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in OCaml.

## Dependencies

Only the OCaml compiler and `dune` are required. 

## Rationale
The code only uses the standard library. As much as possible I tried to implement not too na√Øve solutions. Sometimes the first version of a problem was
an instance of a more general problem (often given in part two), so the preliminary code that gave
the solution for part one was removed.

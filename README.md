# aoc2022
Repository for the [advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in OCaml and Python.

## Dependencies and usage

Programs expect 1 argument on the command-line, the problem number of
the form `nn_parti`, where `nn` is the two digit problem day (between
01 and 25) and `i` must be `1` or `2` to indicates whether to solve
for part 1 or part 2. The program expects the input data on `stdin`.

### OCaml
Only the OCaml compiler and `dune` are required. Run with
```
$ cd ocaml/
$ dune exec --display=quiet -- bin/main.exe 11_part2 < ../inputs/input_11.txt
```
The expected solution for the input is printed on `stdout`.

### Python
Only Python >= 3.8 is required


## Inputs
The `input` directory contains several kind of files.

 - `input_nn.txt` is the real input generated for my account.
 - `output_nn_parti.txt` is the expected output for this particular input
   (usually a single string, often number) for part `i`.
 - `input_nn_xxx.txt` and `output_nn_xxx_parti.txt` are other possible input
  and output pairs given in the problem descriptions. They are often
  smaller and can be worked out by hand most of the time.

## Rationale

The code only uses the standard libraries. As much as possible I tried
to implement not too na√Øve solutions. Sometimes the first version of a
problem was an instance of a more general problem (often given in part
two), so the preliminary code that gave the solution for part one was
removed.
